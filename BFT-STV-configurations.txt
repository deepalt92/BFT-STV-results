200 votes and voters, 500 candidates, 50 committee members
200 votes and voters, 500 candidates, 100 committee members
200 votes and voters, 500 candidates, 200 committee members (fastest so far)



500 votes and voters, 500 candidates, 200 committee members (with a network of 200 nodes)


500 votes and voters, 400 candidates, 200 committee members (with a network of 200 nodes)


(To achieve more scalability you can shard the voting - execute multiple elections with varying voter counts, candidates, and committee members)



1000 votes, 500 candidates, 200 committee members (let's consider 200 a good committee size representing each
country in the world, Ethereum 2.0 in comparison only has 128 validators per shard.) -- took so long, hence sharding...

Break the election into 4 in the same set of nodes ------- 500/4=125, 100/4=25

voting shard #1
250 voters, 125 candidates, 50 committee members

voting shard #2
250 voters, 125 candidates, 50 committee members

voting shard #3
250 voters, 125 candidates, 50 committee members

voting shard #4
250 voters, 125 candidates, 50 committee members

Merge the 50+50+50+50 = 200 committee members

This is done -> It actually turned out to be 1000 voters, 500 candidates, 250 committee members 
(maybe change this to 200 committee members for the reconfiguration because you will execute on 200 VMs/AWS instances)

--------------------------------------------
2000 voters (250 each election), 1000 candidates, 550 committee members -> 647.67 seconds = 10.79 minutes

In comparison, algorands length of governance period is 3 months


let's do 1700 TPS in the yaml, 500 committee members, 2000 voters, 1000 candidates



Tezos reconfiguration is randomized
No rotation in Cardano
No vote in Cosmos, the validator set is selected based on the stake backing there is no democratic election.

Reconfiguration -
Tron - 6 hours , 27 validators, not bribery resistant (PBFT+DPoS)
EoS - 63 seconds, 21 validators, not bribery resistant (BFT+DPoS)
Cosmos - (Tendermit + DPoS)
Polkadot - 24 hours (BFT style + NPoS) 
Blokchains that use NPoS or DPos---
Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron


If you must, use sentry nodes to hide a validator -> write in discussion


 A secure and fair election requires all the following properties:
(1) eligibility - only eligible voters can cast ballots (2) uniqueness - no voters can cast more than one ballot 
(3) soundness - only valid ballots should be counted 
(4) individual and public verifiability - each voter and anyone in the public should be able to verify their vote was cast as intended and counted correctly 
(5) bribery resistance (6) voter anonymity (7) strategic voting resistance and (8) decentralization as per many articles on electronic voting

**voting in Polkadot happens off-chain.... thus cannot use it for any blockchain


**In EOS, each token acts as a vote. The 21 validators that gets the most votes are elected -> what is the top 21 validators are byzantine,

most assume synchrony in DPoS
it assumes asynchrony in BFT consensus - when do you decide the election is over
